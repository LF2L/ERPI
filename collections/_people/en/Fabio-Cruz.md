I'm research associate at the ERPI Laboratory.
The main research interest relies on the distributed recycling via additive manufacturing (DRAM) as a possible socio-technical transition towards a sustainable manufacturing approach in a post-growth future alternative.

I work specifically at the research platform [Lorraine Fab Living Lab (LF2L)](http://lf2l.fr/) in the analysis and implementation of distributed recycling through the [Green Fablab](/projects/green-fablab/) project.
The work that we have developed so far is focused on the technical, logistical and system characterizations which are part of the scope in the validation of the DRAM.

I'm graduated in Mechanical Engineering from the  [National University of Colombia](http://unal.edu.co/), master in Innovation management from the [ENSGSI](https://www.ensgsi.univ-lorraine.fr/) school and PhD in Industrial Engineering from the [Universit√© de Lorraine.](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/).
