Postdoctoral researcher at the ERPI laboratory (Research Team on Innovative Processes) of the University of Lorraine since October 2019.

My main research topics are in the development of methodologies for the design of formulated chemical products, especially cosmetic products. More specifically, my work focuses on the development of computational tools to assist in product design, the application of multicriteria analysis for sustainable product design, as well as the modeling of user preferences.
