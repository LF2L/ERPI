## Title of the thesis

**Modeling and characterization of the damping properties of composite structures obtained by additive manufacturing based on waste**

## Abstract

This PhD project proposed by ERPI in collaboration with LEM3 aims to remove a technical and scientific barrier by allowing the design of ad-hoc structures made from recycled materials locally. To do this, we must go beyond the production of the part, that is to say, describe the static and dynamic behavior of these structures to know their potential for reuse. The work concerns the elaboration of filaments from recycled PS, PP, ABS and TPU materials, the design of composite structures from recycled materials, the characterization of static and vibratory mechanical properties after 3D printing and the proposal of new models of printed composite structures.
