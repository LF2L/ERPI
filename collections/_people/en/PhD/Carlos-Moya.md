## Title of the thesis

**Ability to innovate and collaborate between purchasing departments and SME diggers.**

## Abstract

Considering collaboration as a process, it can be managed and improved, provided you know how to evaluate it, among other things. To address this issue, a method was established and a tool for assessing the ability to collaborate between a customer and his supplier was created as part of an innovation project. Thanks to this tool, partners can obtain the reality of their collaboration practices and a potential improvement plan adapted to the characteristics of the project developed and the quality of the relationship. Thus, the major results of this thesis are:

1. To have qualified the collaboration process in the form of 18 collective practices that will be assessed via maturity grids;

2. To propose a global indicator called “Potential Collaboration / Co-innovation Index (I2CIP)” which makes it possible to classify collaboration according to 4 categories: organized, united, aligned and fusional;

3. To generate the associated improvement plan.

Finally, the test of the tool developed on several study cases enabled its robustness to be established.
