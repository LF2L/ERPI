## Background

He is an electronics engineer of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (UNAL). He received his MSc on a double degree program on Industrial Engineering and Innovation Management from Université de Lorraine (UL) and UNAL. He is co‐founder of the ViveLab Bogotá, where he managed the execution of multiple citizen‐driven innovation projects supported by the national and local government. He also has teaching experience as lecturer in the Master's program on Innovation at the Universidad Antonio Nariño. Today he conducts his PhD research on the design and management of innovation labs under joint supervision at the UL and UNAL. Through the UL, he is involved in the Climate Labs project, an international consortium funded by Eramus+ that seeks to strengthen applied research and innovation capabilities in Latin America through co-creation laboratories for climate change mitigation and adaptation.
 

## Title of the thesis

**Management of Innovation Laboratories: An enabling methodological approach for strategic intent design.**

## Abstract

Since several years now, there has been a proliferation of prodigious spaces for fostering creativity and innovation. Governments, companies, universities, and communities have turned to the implementation of innovation labs as the places where innovation processes are expected to be enhanced through open and agile forms of collaboration. However, past experiences have shown that these initiatives are at risk of not succeeding in their goals. Although multiple studies have explored the innovation lab phenomenon from various perspectives, there is still a gap in understanding what their capabilities are and how they perform. Then, this thesis intends to establish a strategic-oriented methodological approach for guiding the process of design and management of an innovation lab. Firstly, building from existent theory, a maturity grid-based assessment tool is proposed and subsequently tested through an international survey. Complimentary, a multi-case study is set around three cases in order to conduct an in-depth analysis of the evolutionary stages of innovation lab. Ultimately, we seek to provide a collectively-built set of practices and experiences on the way in which spaces have been implemented to support the processes of innovation and creativity. This in order to help those who are willing to start a new Innovation Lab initiative or those who seek to evolve their existing one.
