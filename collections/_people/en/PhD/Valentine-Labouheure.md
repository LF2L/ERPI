## Title of the thesis

**From organisaon to individuals ability to innovate: evaluang the effects in terms of learning and empowerment among Open Innovaon devices stakeholders.**

## Abstract

For more than a decade, ERPI has been studying and experimenng with Open Innovaon devices integrang users in all phases of the design process, even the most upstream. These collaborave approaches, known as Living Labs, are presented as parcularly efficient for producing innovave forms in fields as varied as technology, organisaon, social intervenon, public acon, market services and not -marketers… (Keyson, GuerraSann & Lockton, 2017; Leminen, Niitamo & Westerlund, 2017; Picard, 2019).  

With various centralisaons, ambions, means and methods, Living Labs are found around major principles, including reciprocal contribuon between workshops animators / promoters and parcipants, sharing of knowledge and expériences (Salminen et alii, 2011). In other words, it is not about "using" or "instrumentalizing parcipants during workshops, but rather to enable them to gain knowledge and skills, which we could think of as autonomy gain. Parcipants’ contribuon becomes a central question as soon as the establishment of a Living Lab aims, beyond novelty producon, to develop professional or cizen innovaon capacity in an open way (Ballon, Van Hoed & Schuurman, 2018).  

However, if the contribuons for sponsors are studied, if the effecveness of Living Lab devices for the co-construcon of innovaon has been validated by observaons, parcipants’ contribuon in terms of learning remains less tangible. Therefore, the objectives of the thesis will be to understand: 

+ How do living labs empower parcipants and in doing so, help build their capacity to innovate? 
+ What types of learning took place through this collaborave working mode (beyond the specific content of what the living lab was about)? 
+ How to integrate this dimension, this "reciprocity" in the evaluaon of these modes of intervenon? 
+ How to assess Living Lab relevance in the innovaon process for Orientaon? This questioning fits into our team’s research themes, both in terms of understanding how to create an environment, a culture facilitang the emergence of innovation, and both in understanding the skills necessary to innovation and the most relevant training methods to enable acquision. It arises within the framework of the project AILES (Aid for the Integration of High Schools in Higher Education), PIA supported by the University of Reims / Champagne-Ardennes, the University of Lorraine as well as the rectorates of Nancy-Metz and Reims. This project, which consists of developing new systems helping high schools in their choice of studies, is based on Open Innovation principles, including that of collaboration between the various stakeholders (high school students, parents, secondary and secondary school teachers). Superior, CIO…). Beyond new tools and methods design, the objecve of the project is also to disseminate arts of making from Living Labs to parcipants, to allow them to appropriate them in order to reuse them independently in the context of their professional practice. What will Open Innovaon workshops bring to parcipants is a central question here. It will indeed, be difficult to evaluate this aspect of the project without great understanding of these contributions and methods which allow or hinder autonomy gain.
