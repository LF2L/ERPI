## Title of the thesis 

**Contribution to the measurement and improvement of business performance in an industry 4.0 context**

## Abstract 

Throughout the various industrial revolutions, companies have been confronted to evolve and to improve their processes for acquiring a better performance in order to adapt to new market necessities. Undoubtedly, this new Industrial revolution we are entering into, the so-called Industry 4.0, comes with promising opportunities and also with new fast paced changes. Thus, companies need to be able to adequately respond to them and for doing so, the measurement of the performance plays a key role for them. Unfortunately, while diving into the measurement of the performance, we find in the literature a plethora of definitions and a vast number of indicators. This is undoubtedly bringing a lot of confusion and there is evidence that this is fact is preventing companies to acquire the desired goals in term of performance and to sustain them overtime.  

Based on this need, what it is pursued to address with this thesis is firstly, to understand how a new notion of performance could be for this new context and which could be the performance indicators to be taken into account for better measuring the performance. And secondly, to look into what extent the new technologies and the different type of data could help us to build these indicators as a means to construct a suitable view of the overall performance. Both of the precedent points with a view to develop a novel approach for helping in the decision-making process for improving the performance. In order to cope with these objectives, we have opted for a methodology that includes literature review and an approach of knowledge management through interviews to experts.
