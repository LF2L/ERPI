## Background

I started my studies with a bachelor in industrial technology, followed by a second bachelor in industrial design. In parallel to my studies, I accumulated several experiences mainly in applied research in design, in the management of cultural and territorial projects and in the teaching of design and artistic creation.  

Thanks to these experiences, I continue my studies with a Master 2 in innovation management and industrial design at the University of Lorraine and I carried out a research internship at the ERPI laboratory. In 2017, I started a thesis on the improvement of models and methods for assessing acceptability.


## Title of the thesis

**Improvement of models and methods for the evaluation of acceptability. Application to the Co-design and the implementation of an innovative organization in the health sector, targeting patient management in the case of elderly people**

## Abstract

A major social challenge is to improve autonomy and wellness of Elderly people, in growing number, while controlling the health expenditure.  

Many technology innovations make possible the improvement of certain activities of patient management: sensors of fall, follow-up of daily activities, telemedicine, robots…   

Several articles published recently have insisted on the importance to propose organizational innovations in health sector such as medical care home, intelligent habitat, multi-field private hospital… 

The patient management of Elderly people is characterized by a global insufficient organization of the interventions, with the diversity of the preferences and expectations of the various stakeholders: professional or family caregivers, hospitals, funders, industrials, guardianship …and the multiple risks incurred by Elderly people.  

The comprehensive approach of these risks, the chances of success (acceptability), and the adoption of innovative organizations remain critical.  

Based on our previous work on the acceptability of innovations in health sector and our collaborations with various organizations dealing with patient management, we propose, in practice, to contribute to the diagnosis, the co-design and the implementation of an innovative organization of patient management, i.e., a chain of activities that uses a network of actors and appropriate technologies, for the benefit of wellness of elderly people.
