## Title of the thesis

**Towards a system of recommendations to define the digital strategy of industrial SMEs.**

## Abstract

Recent studies have shown that companies are aware that they must undertake their digital transformation in the coming years. However, the extent of this transformation is difficult to assess. Many organizations consider digital technologies as incremental additions to improve only products or services for customers, but do not consider changing the business within their organizations, their business models and the logic of value creation. This trend is reinforced in industries whose products cannot be fully digitized (Hanelt et al., 2015). Based on this observation, we are currently observing a situation where companies regularly invest in technological development and make incremental progress, without introducing a break in their practices that could lead to new ways of conquering new markets or innovating through digital technology (Fitzgerald et al., 2013). This lack of perspective and the inability to fully utilize the potential of digital transformation is an organizational rather than a technological challenge (Westerman et al., 2011). A digital transformation approach requires a better understanding of digital business strategies (Mithas et al., 2013). Matt et al (2015) argue that companies need established organizational and governance practices (i.e., digital strategies) to coordinate and prioritize a digital transformation as a whole.
 
Moreover, digital transformation is a new subject and there is currently no proposed approach to disseminate best practices or lead to direct roadmaps on how to address all the challenges of this transformation. In addition, digital transformation must be approached in a different way according to the specificities of the company's sector of activity and the company itself (culture, know-how, etc.).
 
This digital transformation is a source of multiple benefits for companies that can improve their ability to innovate, shorten their product development cycles, change their business models, increase productivity, etc.
 
This thesis will address the ability of companies to develop through digital technology by developing a framework for analyzing the digital maturity of the company and proposing a system of recommendations for the company to succeed in its digital transformation.
 
In current practices, we observe that digital transformation often encourages companies to pursue innovations and activities that are not closely linked to the company's existing activities (Hanelt et al., 2015; Matt et al., 2015, Monticolo et al. 2015). Intrapreneurship is, for example, an important source of innovation (Benitez et al., 2010) and more particularly of technological and digital innovation (Menzel et al., 2017, Monticolo et al. 2014). This type of internally developed innovation (called intrapreneurial) in modern organizations is often based on knowledge sharing, an increase in innovative culture, a solid knowledge of digital capabilities, a commitment to technological excellence and a strong organizational vision (Benitez et al., 2010; Christensen et al., 2005). Consequently, the entry into the new digital age seems closely linked to the development of companies' capacity to innovate. However, to date, this interaction between the development of the ability to lead a digital transformation and the development of the ability to innovate has received little attention in the literature. One of the main axes of this thesis will be to analyse this link in order to promote the transformation of companies' practices and enable them to develop their capacity to innovate while integrating digital technologies.
