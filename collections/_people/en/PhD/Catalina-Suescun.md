## Open-Source AM for multi-material plastic recycling in short circuit

## Summary

The  “Factory  of  the  future”  concept  has  existed  for  ten  years.  However,  factory  production  processes changes have few impacts on environmental issues (Deloitte 2015). At the same time, there  is  an  upheaval  in  the  means  of  manufacturing  production.
One  of  the  key  factors  of  these  transformations  is  the  emergence  of  additive  manufacturing  that  allows  productions  in  small  series  in  a  more  economical  way,  faster  and  on  a  local  scale.  Considering  the  different  specificities  of  additive  manufacturing  processes,  a  broad  field  of  opportunity  is  emerging  to  develop more sustainable means of production at different levels of the chain values (Ford  and Despeisse 2016):  
- At  the  design  stage  of  parts:  the  design  is  freer  and  shapes  can  be  optimized  over  parts  modeled for more traditional processes
- At the production stage, by the main principle of additive manufacturing, which consists of  layer-by-layer  manufacturing,  there  is  less  waste  produced  during  production  than  technologies based on the removal or deformation of material.
- In use, the service life of parts is increased by insitu repair techniques.
- Finally, having a production closer to the final consumer reduces the carbon footprint of the property.

It is on the basis of this last point that our project fits. Indeed, this project aims to develop, in the context  of  the  circular  economy,  thermoplastic  materials  recycling  in  a  new  distributed  closed  loop  chain  process closer  to  the  production  site,  and  thus  meet  the  challenges  of  plastic  waste  management.  
Recycling  is  a  well-known  environmental  benefit  and  performing  distributed  recycling of plastic waste into 3-D printing filament decreases the embodied energy of filament by  90%  compared  to  traditional  centralized  filament  manufacturing  using  fossil  fuels  as  inputs  (Kreiger  et  al.,  2013).  Using  distributed  recycling  fits  into  the  circular  economy  paradigm  (Zhong   and   Pearce,   2018),   as   it   eliminates   most   embodied   energy   and   pollution   from   transportation   between   processing   steps.   This   makes   distributed   recycling   and   additive   manufacturing (DRAM) environmentally superior to other methods of plastic recycling.

Specifically, the first objective of this research is to create a comparative assessment to create minimum quality standards in the
3D printing process of recycled material using compatibilizers for composite materials. In a second step we will evaluate the effect of these compatibilizers on the printed structures.  Afterwards, we will transfer all the results previously obtained with commercial machines to open source technologies:

- For the evaluation of materials we will move from a commercial MFI or rheometer solution to an open source MFI system.
- For direct printing of mixed plastics we will move from printing using a Pollen 3D granule machine to a modified large scale open source machine, the Gigabot X.
