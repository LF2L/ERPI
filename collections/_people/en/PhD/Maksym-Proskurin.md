**Proposal of a Digital Innovation approach based on indicators and user experiences to improve the digital product development process**

## Abstract

The main objective of the research project is to propose a Digital Innovation approach based on data from the environment and user experiences in order to improve the digital product development process.
In order to do so, we propose to study classical innovation models, open innovation models, current methods used (lean startup, agile methods, design thinking, sprint design, etc.) and model the dynamic environment of startups in order to propose an adapted digital innovation model (answer to lock 1).
The second sub-objective is to collect, analyse and exploit data (market data, competition data, user experience data) from the startup environment using search and learning techniques. The analysis and exploitation of the data will enable the digital innovation process to be adjusted and adapted as product and service development projects progress (response to lock 2).
The third objective will be to design and develop a recommendation platform for startup organisations so that they can define their strategies for implementing their innovation processes. The recommendation system will use the digital innovation model (objective 1) as well as data analysis algorithms
