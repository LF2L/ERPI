## Title of the thesis

**Value Creation within the relationships of large corporations and startups in open innovation approach in French ecosystem.**

## Abstract

The rapid pace of business evolution is stretching typical large corporation strategies. Hence, large corporations must seek to adopt an agile approach; borrowed from the startup approach. Rather than changing their own playbook; large groups aim to embrace open innovation as a way to evolve and meet any new business context.  As a matter of fact, start-ups and large corporations have opposed strategies: start-ups are looking for product-market fit and exponential growth whereas large corporations are focused on optimization and profitability development.  Yet, large corporations propose more and more open innovation plans targeting startups. 
 
In this thesis, we propose an analysis of the current practices in the corporate world to assess this apparent paradox:  How can large corporations adapt their open innovation offering to startup concerns? How can we compare the different impacts of open innovation plans? A key findings of this analysis is that the success of open innovation is not linked to the organization itself, but to the innovation management plan. Thus; our central research question is: How can we analyze the level of support of an open innovation plan rather than the maturity of the organization that implements it? 
 
This question forms the core of this Ph. D. thesis. We propose a maturity-grid-based framework to analyze the expected added value of open innovation measures proposed by large corporations. We build our grid on two scales: 1) on the type of engagement and relationships between large corporations and startups; 2) on the domains that the development of a startup should consider under the lens of the new ISO standards on innovation management (ISO56002:2019). 
 
We implement this framework for the French ecosystem (CAC 40 companies). Finally, a robustness validation is performed with a startup survey and interviews of large corporations out of CAC 40 group.
