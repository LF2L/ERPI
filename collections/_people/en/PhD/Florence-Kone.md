## Background 

Tchoya Florence Koné is a PhD research student in a CIFRE contract (Industrial Agreements for Training through Research) between Groupe PSA and the Research Center for Automatic Control of Nancy, FR. She holds a master’s degree in systems engineering and project management from ISTIA (University of Angers) and an engineering degree in telecommunications systems and networks from ENSA (Tanger) in Morocco. She is currently in her third year of PhD research.

## Title of the thesis

**Contribution to the specification and demonstration of autonomous vehicle safety, based on situations and
usage scenarios and their probabilistic assessment**

## Abstract

The challenges caused by the autonomous vehicle (AV) are significant. They concern in particular the consideration of the safety of living beings and the integrity of the environment in the design, the difficulty of defining the environment during engineering and the question of assigning responsibility for controlling the vehicle (in whole or in part) to the manufacturer (depending on the level of range).

As a result, the safety issue is no longer limited to the study of AV failures but also extends to the:

+ Demonstration of safety performance at least equal to that of human control,
+ Consideration of deviations from unexpected operational situations,
+ Consideration of transitions between operational situations,
+ Consideration of inadequate performance of AV functions under certain extreme conditions or under the combination of unfavourable external factors, not expected.

Two scientific locks will therefore be treated during the thesis work:

+ Since the situations encountered by an autonomous system are not predictable and given the combinatorial explosion of these real situations, it will be necessary to generate a finite sample of situations (representative of the different classes of situations contained in a mission profile) and use it to assess the safety of each class of situations,
+ As the safety assessments of each class of situations are subject to uncertainty (sampling of all possible situations and scenarios), it will also be necessary to model the uncertainties and compose these assessments in a metric representing the level of confidence that can be placed in the safety of the AV.

This work aims to contribute to the understanding and demonstration of the safety of the autonomous vehicle.
