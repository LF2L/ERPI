## Background

I followed a multidisciplinary mechatronics training at the ENS of Rennes. I then specialized in mechanical engineering through the preparation and obtaining the agrégation de Sciences Industrielles et de l'Ingénieur.
Then, I completed a Master 2 at Centrale Nantes focusing on product design and optimization, and additive manufacturing.
I did my Master's research internship at Polytechnique Montréal, where I studied the modeling of the energy performances of additive manufacturing of composite parts.


## Title of the thesis

**Design the Digital Twin of a Living Lab Project**

## Absract

The field of artificial intelligence has developed the concept of the digital twin. A common definition presents a digital twin as “a digital replica of a living or non-living physical entity.” Or in other words, “a digital replica of potential and actual physical assets (physical twin), processes, people, places, systems and devices that can be used for various purposes.” The major interest of such a technology is to allow the collection of data from the world of physical situations of production of goods and/or services and to transmit them in real time in the virtual world of their representations for analysis by the various engineering departments of product design, production, maintenance ... required to develop solutions, the implementation of which contributes in particular to the development of the industry of the future (known as 4.0).
The objective of this PhD project is to test the principle and immersive technologies as a design support tool in order to better explore the reality of situations of use by making perceptible phenomenological facts whether they are related to events or entities and apply it in a “operational demonstrator” and consequently, to extend the capacity of this demonstrator to represent a certain reality. Building on the work of the INEDIT project and those mentioned above, this project aims to explore and enrich work such as that of (Bouvier, 2009) in order to develop a digital twin as a demonstrator, to provide a a tool for collaborative product design focused on reality and fidelity of usage situations.
