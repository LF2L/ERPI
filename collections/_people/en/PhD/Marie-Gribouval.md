## Background

Before starting this thesis I did a bachelor in Mathematics (first at the University of Rouen and then at the University of Montpellier). Then, I moved to the Master in Data Science and Engineering (Data Science course) again at the University of Rouen. During this master I was able to do a first internship at Orange Labs in Caen where my goal was to train volunteer staff to computer science notions (mainly Scratch, Algobox, Python). Then, my second internship took place at the LITIS in Rouen, it was aimed at allowing clustering under constraints from random forests.


## Title of the thesis

**Conception of a predictive system to evaluate the impact of a numerical device for the orientation of high school students.**

## Abstract

This thesis project contributes to the national project AILES and particularly to the implementation of an analysis system of digital devices to assist in the orientation of high school students. The first objective of the thesis will be to identify the characteristics used by these digital devices. The digital devices for orientation will be deployed on cohorts of high schools from Bac‐3 to Bac+3. The follow‐up of these cohorts will provide data that can be used to understand the impact of digital devices on orientation. This work will be based on the results obtained by the working groups of the AILES project composed of high school and university students, teachers (secondary and higher education) and guidance professionals. The candidate will be integrated into these working groups and into the Living Lab approach of the AILES project so that she can best carry out the identification and data collection. The second objective will be to design a prediction system based on the analysis of data related to digital assistive devices. This system will make it possible to understand and explain the digital devices that help high schools in their orientation process in order to reduce the failure rate in the first year of higher education.
