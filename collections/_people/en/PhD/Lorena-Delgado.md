## Title of the thesis 

Impact of universities innovations spaces design on new product/services development.

## Abstract

Innovation spaces are becoming increasingly popular in both the private and public sectors. Companies and universities are two organizations that have bet on the development of this type of space in the different formats that can be found: Fab lab, maker space, co-work, living labs, etc.  

For companies, it presents an opportunity for the development of innovation projects by integrating the user early on in the creation and design of new products. For universities, this type of space becomes an environment to support teaching and research, but it also becomes an opportunity to generate relationships with the industrial world.  

In recent years the model of the university with an entrepreneurial spirit has been increasingly positioned, giving universities an active participation at the local and regional level (Clark, 1998). In that sense, the entrepreneurial university acquires a "third mission" focused on economic development in addition to research and teaching (Readings, 1996). UNESCO defines three basic functions: teaching and learning, research, and the provision of services to the community in conditions of institutional autonomy and academic freedom (UNESCO, 2009).  

By supporting these three missions, innovation spaces are projected as a support to education and a platform to generate a link with the industry through R&D.  

This projection will depend on the objective with which the space is designed.  

In this context, this research seeks to answer the following questions: What are the factors and dimensions that characterize innovation spaces in universities? How should the design of an innovation space in universities to support the development of their mission? What are the factors that define the process of project development adapted to innovation spaces in universities? How can this process be managed?  

The objective of this research is to define a method to support the design of an innovation space within a university that represents the academic mission, the business mission or that combines the two missions in a mixed way in its operation.  

Subsequently, it is proposed to create a tool for monitoring and generating recommendations for the process of developing products or services within the innovation spaces in universities.
