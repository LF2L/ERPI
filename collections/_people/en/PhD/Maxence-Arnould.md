## Title of the thesis

**The living lab approach to improve wood mobilization in small French private forests**

## Abstract

French private forests represent an important potential of wood mobilization to reach the national objectives set by public policies in terms of the fight against global warming in particular by substituting materials and wood energy from renewable carbon. Nevertheless, private forests have difficulties to mobilize these woods, notably due to the strong fragmentation of ownership. Because of this situation, which has not been resolved for many years, we wish to encourage innovation in the management and mobilization of wood in private forests within regions. We will then propose a generic method intended for the territory's project leaders based on a living lab approach in a perspective of reproducibility and adaptability to the context of each territory. Our approach will enable us to make a double contribution, both scientific with the contribution of methods and tools from the innovation sciences in forestry sciences and operational with a method and tools co-constructed in collaboration with the field actors allowing us to establish a strong link with their needs.
