## Title of the thesis

**Quality evaluation and control for bioink based direct ink write**

## Abstract

Due to the combination of the advantages in cost, non-toxic prosperity, availability in large quantities, environmental sustainability, novel bioinks made from plant fiber show great promise in many medical and industry applications including tissue and regenerative engineering, batteries, sensors, food manufacturing, four-dimensional (4D) printing, civil life products, etc., which make them gain great attention both in industry and academia. Additive manufacturing (AM) can provide personalized designs, high structural complexity, rapid on-demand fabrication at a low-cost, so various AM technologies have been utilized as bioprinting for bioinks including inkjet printing, laser-assisted bioprinting (including laser-guided direct printing and laser-induced direct printing), stereolithography (SLA) bioprinting, and extrusion-based direct ink write (DIW). Among these AM methods, DIW bioprinting has the most prominent advantages in materials flexibility, low cost, and ability to construct arbitrary 3D structures required for advances across multidisciplinary boundaries compared to other technologies, so DIW bioprinting is one of the leading 3D printing techniques for bioinks. However, as a new technology, there are numerous studies that should be done to improve the quality of the final part by bioink based DIW. The primary bottlenecks that limit the bioprinting in DIW for bioinks include three aspects:

1. The lack of a comprehensive and quantitative method to assess bioinks printability for the purpose of selecting a suitable bioink.
2. The lack of comprehensive framework for process parameters selection and optimization for DIW bioprinting for a certain bioink, a certain 3D model and a certain machine.
3. The lack of a close-loop scheme to control the DIW process.  

In order to solve these problems, a framework to evaluate and control quality for bioink based DIW bioprinting should be proposed. As the most important basis for this framework, comprehensive and quantitative expressions for bioinks properties and DIW process are critical for bioinks printability assessment, process parameters selection and optimization as well as process control, which is also one of the core objectives of this thesis. Therefore, in the first part of the thesis, bioinks properties related to process are studied and described mathematically firstly. Bioinks properties related to DIW process include density, surface tension and viscosity model. Density and surface tension can be easily obtained by instruments as constants. Viscosity property describes the relationship between viscosity and shear rate of bioinks. Viscosity changes with shear rate and data of viscosity related to shear rate are obtained by viscosity experiments using rheometer. A trust-region reflective algorithm (TRRA) and genetic algorithm (GA) combined hybrid algorithm is designed for viscosity model selection. Then, numerical simulations of extrusion processes including extrusion in the air and extrusion on the substrate are carried out on OpenFOAM® to explore the printing process. For simulation of extrusion in the air, flow of the bioink is based on finite volume method (FVM), and capture for interface between bioink and air is based on volume of fluid (VOF) method. For simulation of extrusion on the substrate, besides flow and capture for interface between bioink and air same as extrusion in the air, the movement of the nozzle used a mesh motion approach based on a solver for Laplacian of the diffusivity and the cell motion velocity. Based on the simulation, the whole DIW process could be investigated as a multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) system. Inputs include bioink properties (density, surface tension, viscosity model) and process parameters (piston speed, nozzle speed, gap between nozzle and substrate). Outputs include speed and shape of extruded filament in the air; shape of final part on the substrate. Afterwards, printing tests for extrusion in the air and extrusion on the substrate are conducted to verify the proposed viscosity model selection method for bioinks and simulations of the extrusion process in DIW.  

Based on the MIMO system for bioink based DIW bioprinting obtained by the first part of the thesis, in the second part, the second objective of the thesis, which are bioinks printability assessment, process parameters selection and optimization as well as process control based on the MIMO system, are studied respectively.
For bioinks printability assessment, the purpose is to propose a method for assessing bioink with certain properties is printable for one certain DIW machine or not. Several experimental methods have been developed. However, experimental methods are time, material consuming and measurements of some critical process parameters are limited in test ability during experiments. To solve these problems, a simulation method to assess bioinks printability in DIW bioprinting is proposed as complement to experimental methods. Firstly, physical properties of bioinks including density, surface tension coefficient and viscosity model are characterized using material tests and data analyses. Then, the simulation assessment method has two steps. The first step is to simulate the extruded filament in the air to obtain the shape and velocity profiles of the filament. The second step is to simulate filaments on substrate and characterize bioink printability based on shape profile of filaments on substrate. Finally, an experimental method was conducted to verify the proposed assessment method.
For process parameters selection and optimization as well as process control, we will start these two contents from the second year.
