An intelligent system for e-cruitment optimization


## Abstract  

The field of e-recruitment is surging as recruiters struggle to properly distributing the job offers throughout the numerous broadcasting channels. E-recruitment is a costly repetitive process both in time and money. It is impacted by the growing importance of social media and other channels. As a metter of fact the traditional recruitment process are more and more challenged by the growing realm of possibilities offered by the use of big data on the internet. We are looking to study the prospective of artificial intelligence, science which purpose is to automate human tasks by using the intelligence of machines, in this fields of recruitment.
