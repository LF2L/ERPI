## Background

Industrial Engineer from Universidad de Santiago de Chile and Master MIDI from Université de Lorraine. After finishing my master's studies, I have continued with my doctoral studies, which I am currently doing. 

## Title of the thesis

**Short circuit valorisation of thermoplastic waste for the conception by 3D printing of composite structures.**

## Abstract

These last few years, the ERPI laboratory has implemented a physical platform dedicated to the innovation process acceleration, the LorraineFabLivingLab(LF2L). It integrates a community of users laboratory and a Fablab enabling the rapid 3D materialization of objects and solutions.  The Fablab is mutating toward the notion of « Green Fablab » which is a pilot facility enabling a better use of resources at the local scale. Within this framework, several still on going works are been carried out, from a technical point of view looking at the recycling process feasibility, but also for the raw materials integration within the geographical perimeters of the LF2L.
