## Background

I joined the ENSGSI Engineering School in 2014, after preparatory classes. Once I graduated, I have been a project management consultant to the CEA, assigned to one of the nuclear research reactors at the Saclay site, for more than a year.


## Title of the thesis

**Assesment of the maturity of industrial processes and recommandation system to help technological choices and transformation stages in order to improve the industrial performance of companies.**

## Abstract

The context of the fourth industrial revolution raises several issues that lead us to think about on the assessment of technological maturity and the implementation of a transformation process. These approaches must take into account the technological, organizational, cultural and competitive aspects of industries in the perspective of improving its business models (production models, factory management models, maintenance models, etc.) through the evolution of industry 4.0 technologies. In order to support companies during this new industrial revolution and to deal with the scientific obstacles identified, three objectives to be achieved during this research work were chosen:  

- The first objective of the thesis will be to conduct an in-depth study of the approaches and models of technological transformation in the industry described in the literature but also currently used in companies.  

- The second objective will be to propose a framework for assessing the technological maturity of companies in order to design a technological 'roadmap' allowing to target the actions to be implemented to define a transformation plan. Emphasis will be placed on the contributions of industry 4.0 technologies facilitating the improvement of industrial processes, production performance gains and optimization of the supply chain.  

- The third objective will be to design a system of recommendations based on the analysis of maturity and whose objective will be to assist the teams (management, production, maintenance, logistics, etc.) in the definition of their technological transition strategy. This strategy should make it possible to maximize the acquisition of value for the company while taking into account its ability to integrate new technologies in a thoughtful way with a view to improving its industrial knowledge and skills.
