## Background and contact 


Thanks to my studies as a chemical engineer at the National University of Colombia, I had the opportunity to be part of research groups with different approaches, I participated in several research projects, I gained a varied experience that led me to acquire skills to work in laboratories and use a variety of techniques and equipment. Curiosity and enthusiasm led me to become a specialist in product design and development, where I developed teamwork skills, participated in the development of multidisciplinary projects, as well as in scientific and market studies in atypical engineering fields such as behavioural sciences.  My academic, professional and entrepreneurial career led me to choose a thesis in the design of cosmetic products.
