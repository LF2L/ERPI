Engineer and PhD in industrial engineering, my professional and research experiences focus mainly on the metrology of companies' internal processes from a multidimensional perspective: innovation, export, industrial protection, etc. This assessment of companies' internal capacities is based on the application of multi-criteria analysis methodologies in order to design evaluation and decision-making tools. Particular attention is paid to the particular case of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), highlighting the need to propose joint visions of these internal practices and processes, through systemic and complex thinking.
