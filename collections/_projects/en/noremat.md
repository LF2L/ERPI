# SAGID - Innovative roadside management

## Global context

In a context where transport infrastructures are confronted with societal, territorial, political, technical and technological changes, it becomes essential to review their place in society. The construction and maintenance of transport infrastructure involves elements of assessment related to the economic role of transport, public safety and the living environment as well as the preservation of the environment. The consequences of the choices made, particularly in terms of spatial planning, have repercussions in the long term.   

It is therefore time to make infrastructure management strategies more resilient and adapted to the new conditions imposed by the planet. It must be said that while in theory this may seem simple and obvious, in practice the difficulty of deploying an environmentally friendly strategy remains. In order to facilitate the implementation of new road dependency management strategies, it is necessary to develop decision support tools to evaluate the economic, environmental and societal externalities and thus the impact of these management strategies on the environment and society.



## Research goal

In order to support the actors of the territory in the management of transport infrastructures, this project seeks to develop a decision support tool for the actors of the territory. This tool, based on dynamic systems modelling, seeks to facilitate the evaluation of a road dependency management strategy upstream. The proposed approach will be tested on target territories and will be an integral part of a road dependency management demonstrator.
The GID-Route project, in its first phase (September 2017-February 2019) has enabled to identify criteria for assessing the sustainability of roadside management impacts, through a literature review and interviews with stakeholders and develop a systems dynamics model allowing the integration of the various criteria and their possible interactions;
The second phase of the project focuses on the development of a decision support tool through a user-centered approach favoring an innovative and sustainable management of roadside dependencies as well as the associated territorial demonstrator. A territorial demonstrator will be designed in connection with the decision support system in order to show the impacts of innovative and sustainable management of road dependencies.
