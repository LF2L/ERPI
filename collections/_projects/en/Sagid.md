# Chair SAGID+ - Support for Roadside Vegetation Management Professions through Comprehensive and Sustainable Management


<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.powtoon.com/embed/evWOEp1adMl/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This chair places special emphasis on roadside and is interested in establishing sustainable management of these vegetated spaces, with the ability to mitigate the negative impacts of roads on biodiversity and play a fundamental role in its preservation. However, currently, various stakeholders at the territorial level lack operational methodologies/models that enable them to simultaneously consider and assess all the previously mentioned challenges.

Recent studies have shown that current research on roadside management is approached in a fragmented and disciplinary manner. They have also highlighted a lack of formal models for addressing the complexity of such a system and integrating data from various sources and disciplines.

The overall goal of the chair is to develop ’turnkey’ tools and methods capable of assessing the sustainability of practices implemented in the decision-making process, supported by artificial intelligence, and then contribute to integrating the profession into bioeconomy sectors and promoting eco-responsible behaviors.

## Objectifs de la recherche

### Scientific

1. Enhance the economic, environmental, and socio-territorial performance of roadside.
2. Promote eco-responsible behaviors regarding roadside management.
3. Integrate the profession of roadside vegetation manager into the bioeconomy sectors.

### Operational

1. Enhance knowledge about roadside.
2. Develop tools and methods capable of assessing the sustainability of roadside management practices.
3. Support public management and actions in favor of roadside.
