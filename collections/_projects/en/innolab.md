## Why Innovation Labs?

Organizations all around the world are increasingly interested in creating dedicated physical spaces to foster innovation processes. Since the 2000s, companies, universities, non-profit organizations, communities and even governments have opted to have their own “lab”.
These particular spaces have become very popular as they are seen as manifestations of change, sources of inspiration and beacons of hope in a rapidly changing and demanding world.

However, concerns driven by misperceptions often appear when it is asked "what makes an innovation lab". This could lead to an identity crisis in which, in some cases, the concerned parties refer to them as "innovation gadgets", isolated places to do "cool stuff" and measured by "vanity metrics". As hosts of our own innovation laboratories, we know the potential that these collaborative platforms can offer on the path towards the transformation of our territories and societies.
And at the same time, we are aware of the challenge of operating and sustaining them.

That is why we believe that by studying innovation labs, sharing experiences and understanding how they are being managed, we can contribute to the consolidation of inspiring spaces where people can connect with each other, enhance their creative thinking, make use of new technologies and offer solutions with
significant impact.


## Research Goal


The aim of this research project is to propose an enabling methodological approach for the strategic intent design of innovation laboratories based on their context and organizational capabilities.

Ultimately, we seek to collectively build new knowledge on practices and experiences on the
way in which spaces have been implemented to support the processes of innovation and
creativity. In this way, we hope for lab host teams to find a source of inspiration for
empowering the management of their collaborative platform.

## Current Research


**Management of Innovation Laboratories: An enabling methodological
approach for strategic intention design**

Digital transformation and technology democratization are enabling the creation of new business models which driven by values such as trust, transparency and openness are leading to changes in all socio-economic instances. These are just some of the characteristics of this transformative moment we are living in and that challenge the traditional foundations of our society. Precisely, it is through the emergence of new collaborative organizational structures the way we can bring out our collective responsibility to lead the evolution of our communities, business and territories.

Innovation Laboratories have emerged around the world as a type of favourable places for innovation processes to happen. As these laboratories are highly context-dependent, they vary significantly from one another, giving rise to multiple notions of what they are, how they work and what we should expect of them. This global issue should be of interest, as embarking on the adventure of creating an innovation laboratory involves dealing with substantial financial issues and great difficulty in getting the best out of it. Due to their relative novelty and mediating nature, they are difficult to understand, manage and value
their outcomes.
Thus, our motivation to pursue this issue is to contribute to the comprehension of this phenomenon and to provide managers, academics and interested parties with practical knowledge and useful tools for the design and management of innovation laboratories.
