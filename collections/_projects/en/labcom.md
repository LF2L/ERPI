## The Joint Research Lab: Humans at the heart of the challenges of the digital world

The LabCom is centered in the study of digitally supported human-to-human and human-machine interactions, with a vision of: technology at the service of mankind.

Digital technology is used to help and amplify people's decision-making and management skills in increasingly complex environments (increasing number of data to be processed, more frequent interactions between stakeholders, Virtual vs. Real interface, etc.).

## Aims

The aim of this research program is to develop and further integrate Acceptability assessment indicators using psychophysiological sensors (developed by TEA) on the human activity analysis solutions (software by TEA)


## A gathering of skils, expertises and ressources

The LabCom is a Research program financed by the ANR between the ERPI research team and the SME TEA.

**TEA** is a French SME leader in the market of measure of human activity in real complex environements. With more than 30 years of R&D and a stong link with scientifique expertise. TEA develops and sells several products that allow to assess human activity in real or virtual environements.

**ERPI** scientific skills and knowledge on collaborative innovation processes and its expertise on user-centered innovation practices will be used to develop shared demonstrators on specific market applications.

This program will allow the development of products and solutions to TEA to access new growth markets (industry 4.0, Neuro-Marketing, smart-city...) as well as the development of shared demonstrators of solutions on specific application markets.
