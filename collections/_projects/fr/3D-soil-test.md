The ERPI leads a consortium of five laboratories (INRA, LRGP, LSE et Geo Ressources) to develop an innovative system to monitor the evolution of the organic matter in soils.

This subject is of great importance in the context of actions for a sustainable environment. The work to be carried out concerns numerical modeling, material selection, defining the specifications of the additive manufacturing process and the production of prototypes.
