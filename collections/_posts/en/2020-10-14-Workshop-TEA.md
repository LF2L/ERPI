## SAVE THE DATE !  

# As part of the activities of the ANR joint laboratory between the ERPI laboratory and the TEA company, we are organizing the workshop "Virtual reality and Ergonomics: performance levers"  
  
  
# WORKSHOP T.E.A x TECHVIZ



### November 3, 2020

-------------------

**Virtual reality** makes it possible to **reduce costs in the long term**, to **""First Time Good" and to **integrate the actors** from the early stages of solution design.  

In the **digitalization** approach of companies, it is a performance lever, used to support **training** and conduct **awareness** campaigns.

By placing people at the heart of the processes, it also makes it possible to intervene in the phases of a project: from **design ergonomics**, to **process optimization**, but also **development studies**, etc. in various sectors such as industry, construction, but also architecture.

**TechViz** and **TEA** have formed a partnership to offer a **innovative integrated solution combining virtual reality and motion capture**.

This solution makes it possible to integrate CAD models into virtual scenes and to incorporate the analysis of the posture of the individual, his ergonomics and his interactions with the environment.
