Their challenge: **3 days to define solutions to transform a traditional SME into a 4.0 SME**.  

The participants first worked on business process modeling based on interviews from SME employees.  
They also deepened their understanding of the technologies and approaches of the industry of the future.  
Finally, they considered solutions to transform the SME by analyzing the organizational and strategic impacts of their proposals.  


The teams, supported by their respective facilitators, have done a consistent and successful job. They had the opportunity to close this event by presenting their proposals before a Franco-German jury of experts and professionals, giving rise to rich exchanges.  

In view of the success of this first edition, this challenge will be repeated in the **summer of 2021 at the Technische Universität Kaiserslautern**, in face-to-face.
