<FONT size="15pt">SAGID: Innovative roadside management received the Solar Impulse Efficient Solution label!</FONT>  
  


<p align="justify">The <b>Solar Impulse</b> label rewards efficient, clean and profitable solutions that have a positive impact on the environment and quality of life.

In a context of resource scarcity due to climate change, roadside management today only consumes resources, while it has untapped production potential if it is managed sustainably.

Supported by the <b>NOREMAT</b> company and the <b>ERPI laboratory</b> (Research Team on Innovative Processes) of the University of Lorraine, the <b>SAGID project</b> aims to develop an innovative management system to support the territories in the sustainable management of roadsides.

This tool should therefore help managers to identify and quantify economically the impacts of the alternative management of road dependencies compared to conventional road maintenance. These impacts are social (recruitment of new skills, local partnerships between farmers, public authorities, companies), economic (less frequent maintenance operations, for example cleaning ditches, added value of biomass for energy production), and environmental (production of renewable bioenergy without competition with food crops, preservation of water quality and improvement of biodiversity).</p>
