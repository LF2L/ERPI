Researchers from the [ERPI laboratory](https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/) of the University of Lorraine and the company [NOREMAT](http://www.noremat.com/) welcomed representatives from various institutions and organizations such as the Greater Nancy Metropolis, DIR-Est, Cerema, Scalen, Eurovia, Agroparistech as well as several entrepreneurs in the sector. 
At the end of the workshop, the importance of valuing the benefits of the different interview strategies emerged, as well as adapting them to the local context. Finally, raising awareness and informing citizens about these benefits is essential in order to change attitudes towards a more sustainable management of roadside verges.
